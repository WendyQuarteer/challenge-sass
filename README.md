SASS  https://sass-lang.com/install

      https://brew.sh

Part 1

Make one mixin for the 3 lines of the box-shadow styling.

https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin

Make the general padding the same everywhere with one variable. (red=16px, blue=8px), the footer h6 should have double the padding of the other elements. Use "operations" to do this. Do NOT hardcode the padding inside your scss.

https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators

Nest the styling rules of grouped elements, like the sections in the Article.

https://sass-lang.com/guide

Make use of extend to re-use the same CSS for the "success", "error" and "warning" messages.

Part 2 (optional)

Add an option to your compilation to minify your stylesheet! Mine was below 1.6k, can you do better? Do you still remember the option to ls to make the filesize Human readable?
